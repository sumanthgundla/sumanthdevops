usig of terraform install in your machine for excute terraform script's
terraform worked with all cloud's
terraform --version
cloud related plugin want to domload. for checking provider.tf 
by default all .tf file's reads in that directory
terraform want acces key,scerete key,cloud
aws is dedicated to region only
state.tf file. 
state file in json 
terraform stored what he did in tfstate filre
terrafor init it will download plugins in .terraform 
terraform.io
each and every service in terraform.io having 2 section.
====================
if resouser is list we can use []
if resource is map we can use---- {}
single value =""
==========================================
terraform --version
terraform init 
if reserved word no need to give double quote's
if not reserved word need give in double quote's
in terraform.io section we have 2 section's resourse nd data source.
if resource having list keyword we can give []
if resource is map we can give {}
if resource is key and value format e can give double guote's
ami is reconized word for terraform.
ami identified by ami id.
terraform apply
terraform destroy
terraform plan
terraform validate.
machine will ceate in subnet
resource attribute value i want

==========================================
section --01

create vpc
attache igw
create 2public subnet + 2private subnet
create a public route table+ private route table
create a nat gateway attached to private subnet 
nate gate way created in public subnet atached to private subnet route table
create sg group's an aattched to pubsubnet server's and private subnet server's
create a key pair attached to all ec2 instance's
upload your public key into aws
create ec2 in sn1 and attach sg and keypair.
enable public ip auto assign ip in public subnet
=========================
first identify the resource name
if vpc created 
1.nacl created--it act as a security group for subnet it is a state less.
2.security group--it act as a security for ec2 it is state full
3.route tabel
subnet attached  route table having igw that subnet we can call it as public subnet
subnet having route table not having igw that subnet is private subnnet.
 
=============================
create vpc using tag's Name="vpc1"
create subnet's also give Name="sn1-vpc1" like that 
============================================
i want to make sn1 & sn2 as a public.
subnet associated route table having ineternet gateay that subnet is public subnet
tag's for identification
first identified the route
ingress-inbound rule
egress-outbound rule
security group having in,out bound rule's
security group act firewall to ec2instance.
public allways with aws
private key allways with us
first identifiy the resource
auto assign public ip we have to do subnet level
map_public_ip_launch is bydefaulr false we have to make it as true.then what we are launchingserver's in that subnet assignpublic ip.
load balancer's in public subnet's
server in private subnet's
we are attaching load balancer's with private subnet's server's
on which port number send req user 
(ip+port)
elb port,instance port
elb having own sg.
we can attache sg saparate for elb and instancess
elb req send's to instance when instance is health that means on port number service is ruunin stage
elb send's req to health server's only.
beside resource name is logical name for resource.
â”‚ Error: Error creating ELB: InvalidConfigurationRequest: ELB cannot be attached to multiple subnets in the same AZ.
valu's are not hardcodess
1 az 1 subnet
server in one subnet
for write in ec2 we can use file fuction,<<EOF 
OYHER WISE WE CAN USE function methode.

===============================================
we can create using launch template with multiple
we can't with launch configuration

autoscalling group machine's are automatically registyerd with elb's
elb i allreday attached to route 53
autoscalling and sns both must be in same region

=================================================
sns i want to attach auto scalling group's
in autoscalling activity we havw to create and attcahed to the our sns topic to them.
when if launch instance,terminate, etc.. it ill give to us notification
============================================
pending

vpc endpoint's
rds
s3
secrete manager
=================================================

requirement must be clear 
when ever instance launch in public subnet we have to eneble the that option
dont do 100 lines code excution
one by one you have to do
any programing having some reserved word's
reserved ord no need to put in double quote's
unreserved word key word's [ut i it into doublequote's
some values are constant 
some values are dynamic
dynamic values no need to put ith in double quote's
e have to give vpcid hardcode means you can go to aws select and take it from console
if list--[]
if map---{}
if list of objet's----{}
route i created 2 type's plz check
client------route5-------elb
--------targetgroup------vpc---ig----nacl----sg----ec2---
--ebserver----application path----my file
=======================================================================================
we have 4 type's varible
list
map
object
key

we are declare in terraform variable 

variable "v_sz"{
	default=20
}
===========================
count we can call as meta-varibale
each and evry resource section it have a mate-parameter's
each and evry resource section count having and that count value is 1
count=1 by default so that resource will excute  1 time only 

if count=2 that resource section will be excute 2time
s
by default not visible 

if count=0 means that resource section not excuted
leanth function

/*

count.index------>1--->2--->

leanth fuction it will print length of the variable 
array start with 0
*/

count ill e use in resource section only e are not use in output 

=============================================
if you have any value crete variable
create varibale then place that variable into resource section 
variable we can create in saparate file for clarity
where where multiple you have to create we need to create variable use that thing
we have to joinn the value's we can use join function
join function argument 2 1 is string 2 nd is list s

join("-",["vpc",[var.var_tags])
join(separator, list)

list1starugumrnt+saparator
list2nd argument+saparator

join("gundla",["sumanth","dinesh"])
sumanthgundladinesh

join(",",["sumanth","dinesh"])
sumanth,dinesh

in loist section you can give any number of string

web-vpc

variable "tags"{
	default="live"

}

value=join(","[var.tags,"vpc"])


================================================
if you want to check anything resource in aws pick vpcid 
then use that id you can found any resource releted to the that vpc
static values put it into resource section
dynamic values put it in it variable section.
dont hard code the values
if you want to use in future you can do
=================================
variable e can call variable var.variable name
leangth fuction give a no of element from that varaible
count default value is 1 
join fuction add the inputes
count.index means we can keep where it is that no is zero then itration done
then go to 1

count default value is 1
========================================= 

Dinnu91827-----hitachi passd

==================================================
variable's
how to refer varaible=var.variblename
length 
count=1 how many values  we give that  much times it will excute
count.index=0   default value zero if itaration will incress
join
there are lot f function avalable in the terraform 
substring
trace

================================= 
conditions

condition always give result true/false

comparision operator's
>
<
<=
>=
== both are equal are not
!=
there all are comparison opreator's
it ill do compare then give true/false
we want to values per comparision

how to write a condition

synatx:
condition ? value1 : value2
condition ? shahsi : harsha
a>b?"sheshi":"harsha"

a=10
b=40
10>40:false so it ill print right hand side value

if prod eip will create then attacheded to instance

count=env=var.env?"0":"1"

===========================
what is your terraform architecture

all variables we can put it into one file
all resourcess e will put into another file

=====================================================
FROM tomcat
WorkDir /app
RUN apt-get update 
RUN apt install net-tools
RUN apt-get install git
cmd [git --version]
Expose 90
MKDIR /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
COPY ./index.html /usr/local/tomcat/webapps



docker build -t imahe1:v1 .
======================================
variable aws:we can give which infrasture will automate
resource:to creat a resource
varibale" to create varibale we can give
output; print the resource value
========================
count: how many times that resource sectiuon excute
count.index: default=0
lenagth: to know length of give no of element in that list resource
file:read the data from file
element:which index value you want index starts from 0.
join : join 2 thing's
===========================================
how to do multiregion provisioning:
provisioning means : we can creating the resource
infrasture privisionfg
i want to crrte mutile region i want to create multiple regions
load balancer only send req to one region server's only.
cat *.tf
terraform validate ----it will check synatax
terraform plan : it will shown only which thng are creating
====================
we are giving avalabilyity zone us-east-1a
erraform what we mention in provider.tf then go to the mumbai 
then check the avalabiltiy zone
=========================================
inbuilt meta parameter 
parameter name is provider
we can give synta x
provider="aws.sing"
e can define multiple provider's in other provider we can metion alias name
then we can metion in resource section meta parameter provider 
in resource section we need to metion in resource section 
it applicable for all resourcess
==========================
in provider .tf file e are do the hardcode code
======================
provisioners 4 to 5 provisioners are there
a) connect
b) file
c) remote-exec
d) local-exec

what is the functinality of the provisioner's
the main functnality is provisioner's will excute at the time of resource creation 
not modified time of resource

connect provisioning: when resource created then i want to connect the resource using of connect provision
file provisiong: file we can copy to aws ec2 instance from terraform machine using file provising 
remote-exec provisiong: when resource created then it will go to aws ec2 instance 
it will excute scrpts
it will excute some commnad terraform will excute aws ec2 instance

local-exec: it will scripts excute in terraform machine
=======================================================================

how terraform knows this is windows server or linux server terraform dont know any thinfg
it linux machine it will use ssh coonection
it windows machine it will ise the rdt connection

if linux: username,passwd,username,ssh port.
how terraform knows which user want to excute scrpts : we have to give 
if linux : wiyh passwdord,it is with private key 
if any provising i can use connect provising foe connection
terraform will connect to ec2 instance ec2 security group ib rule open terraform ip
or open all traffic port is 22 port
==============================================
i wanto to crearte instance then i want to copy file from local machine to aws instance
provisioner section will excute at the time of resource creation
if modified that resource proviing not create


provisioner section will excute one time
==============
i want to excute command in the aws from terraform machine 
you can use inline
in i th tken input list
inline=["cat f1",cat f2]....
inline also excute only one time at the time of resource creation
this is called remoe excution
syntax ss taken
====================================================
null_resource: it will excute purpose we have some plugin's also 
so we can add in .tf script then run terraform init 
when ever terraform apply null_resource section first destory then create again
so we can metion in that resource provisioners

nullresoursesimply we can use for the provisioners
if any chages done in nll resource it will destroy thencreate again
when ever tf script will excute file will be excute
we are using provisioner's in resource section
while resource is ecuted provising will excute
================
if any dependency is there 1st ill excute that thing then excute depency thing
if no dependency it resorcess will excute parelly
==========================================
if any dependdent is there we can use dependent_on
i want to create volume then i ant to attache to instance
if volume not created then instance also not created
depends_on=[aws_instance.i1,aws_vpc.vpc01]----it is list 
when that input will create then only this resource will create 
by default terraform will create resourcessparrell
============================================
localsection in terraform
dynamic section in terraform
data source : data source will reads the resource infomaration
resource: in aws any thing is resource
==================================
all data source's will start with "data"

==============================================
TERRAFORM WANT'S TO READ ALL VARIABLE DATA FROM FILE
THAT FILE IS .TFVARS
TERRAFORM -HELP
terraform apply -help
terraform apply -vat-file=test1.tfvars -auto-approve
you want to excute particular section in .tf file 
terraform apply -target=aws_vpc.vpc1
terraform destory -target=aws_vpc.vpc1
==================================================
each subnet create public subnet,private subnet
check local
dynamic
check local-exec
